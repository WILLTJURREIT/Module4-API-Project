# Module 4 Milestone 0

## Overview

The goal of this milestone is to create a static HTML/CSS mockup of the web application I plan to build using the New York Times Top Stories API.

## Application

The purpose of my web app, *Top Stories Hub*, is to provide users with a simple way to browse the latest New York Times Top Stories. This is an app that collects the latest top stories in a particular section (e.g. arts, sciences, politics, etc.) and presents stories or headlines in an interesting way. (Chosen from the "possible app ideas" section of the iunstructions) The app displays selectable news categories such as Business, Technology, World, and Arts, and includes a keyword filter to help users refine the articles they want to explore. In later milestones, users will also be able to save articles for later reading. For Milestone 0, I created this static HTML and CSS mockup that demonstrates the intended layout, semantic page structure, interaction options, and design. This milestone focuses on structure and layout, not functionality.

## How to View the Project

Open the index.html in any web browser to view the mockup, in the index file right click and choose to open in default browser, this should open the UI and make it viewable.

## Files Included

- index.html The main layout of the web app mockup.
- style.css All styling for the mockup..
- README.md Documentation for the project and explaining Milestone 0.

## Conclusion

With this first Milestone complete I am set up for my next stages of my apps development. Some options may be altered or removed and the app might have some slight modifications, however, this app is going to be directly based on one of the given possible ideas.
