# **Module 4 Milestone 2**

Steps taken:

1. Create files and folders, Public folder containing app.js, index.html, style.css
2. Create other files database.json (this will act as the database for the assignment)
3. Install npm init -y to make this project use node, and create the json files which will handle the use of node.
4. Get API Key from NY Times site, make an account and get API Key V****gnfTyrMrLa14ADwIa2wUNB2
5. Once I have got this API Key I need to put it some place, so I will store this into a variable in my app.js, I feel this might not be the most secure way to handle the API Key, but for the purpose of this assignment for now I will store into a constant variable "API_KEY".
6. Add saved.html, for a better place the saved top stories can go.
7. Add saved.js to help with the functionality.
8. Add css to help with buttons and styling.
9. Clean up the code in index.html, now that I will have the top stories on the main page, and saved stories in the saved page. Add navigation to navigate between the pages.
10. Get all references into my app.js file.
11. Added Axios script tags fromt he website. Axios is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to request data from APIs, and the site I found the tag at is https://axios-http.com/docs/intro. I am using axios to help simplify the process.
