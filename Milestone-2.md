# **Module 4 Milestone 2**


Steps taken: 

1. Create files and folders, Public folder containing app.js, index.html, style.css
2. Create other files database.json (this will act as the database for the assignment)
3. Install npm init -y to make this project use node, and create the json files which will handle the use of node.
4. Get API Key from NY Times site, make an account and get API Key V****gnfTyrMrLa14ADwIa2wUNB2
5. Once I have got this API Key I need to put it some place, so I will store this into a variable in my app.js, I feel this might not be the most secure way to handle the API Key, but for the purpose of this assignment for now I will store into a constant variable "API_KEY".
